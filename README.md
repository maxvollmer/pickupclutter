A mod for Stardew Valley that allows you to pick up and relocate rocks, twigs, and weeds.

I created this mod while fixing my DeepWoods ï»¿mod and encountering a bug that allowed picking up rocks, twigs, and weeds. After figuring out the cause of the bug, a user in the comments suggested making a mod that adds the bug as a feature. And here we are.

I made a Youtube video where you can watch me create this mod: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKsL62TW820
